In the Risk Analysis.Rmd file in our data analysis directory, the concrete_OR function was created to calculate the odds ratio for being infected with dengue by whether the house is made of concrete or not. Now we will test a calculate odds ratio function with test data to be able to use in future odds ratio calculations for updated concrete house data.

```{r}
#define an odds ratio calculation function
calculate_odds_ratio = function(data) {
 n_infections_concrete = sum(data$any_infections[data$concrete_house == 1])
 n_no_infections_concrete = sum(!data$any_infections[data$concrete_house == 1])
 odds_concrete = n_infections_concrete / n_no_infections_concrete
  
 n_infections_nonconcrete = sum(data$any_infections[data$concrete_house == 0])
 
 n_no_infections_nonconcrete = sum(!data$any_infections[data$concrete_house == 0])
 
 odds_nonconcrete = n_infections_nonconcrete / n_no_infections_nonconcrete
  
 return(odds_concrete / odds_nonconcrete)
}
```
